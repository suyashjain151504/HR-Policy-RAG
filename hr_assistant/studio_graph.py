"""studio_graph — entry point: LangGraph Studio (`langgraph dev`).

Exposes the agent's compiled graph so Studio can visualize and step
through it (nodes, edges, state at each step, tool calls) in the browser.
Connects to the clean HR Qdrant collection at import time — run
`python ingest.py` first.
